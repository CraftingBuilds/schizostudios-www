      <p>
        The Helping Spirits Division exists at the intersection of action and presence. It recognizes <em>helping</em> as both a <strong>verb</strong> and an <strong>adjective</strong>—the act of assisting, and the nature of benevolence itself.

    <!-- ANNOUNCEMENT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="spirits">Announcement · Technomantic High Craft Framework</h2>

      <p>
      ===== BEGIN FRAMEWORK =====
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Technomantic High Craft is the understanding that in modern times and the modern world technology is but another resource to be utilized, and a tool, that with proper use, does not need to be seen as something to avoid, put away, or be considered a distraction. It is the realization that technology does not inherently need to be discluded from metaphysical and spiritual workings, nor that its presence in such workings negates or discounts the results or the practice itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technomantic High Craft is not separate from High Craft, but a unique branch in which the practitioner includes various forms of modern, sometimes everyday - nothing special, technology in their Craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order for an occurrence to be considered Technomantic High Craft there is a requirement that the use of technology either has, or is a means to fulfil, intent. The second qualification requirement for an action, or set of actions, to be considered Technomantic High Craft is that the action(s) must meet the criteria that is used to first classify as High Craft. The same rules of disclusion from an action or set of actions being classified as High Craft apply to Technomantic High Craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often times there is an understood acceptance that to be specified as Technomantic High Craft the practitioner must implement the use of modern, electronic technology in a fashion that either puts emphasis on, or would be unachievable without the use of said technology.
      </p>

      <p>
      ===== END FRAMEWORK =====
      <p>
        This recognition exists to provide clarity—not prescription—and to support practitioners navigating contemporary realities without abandoning principled craft.

          <p>
            <strong>Helping (verb) spirits</strong> are those forces—internal or external, symbolic or experiential—that participate in guidance, protection, clarity, and support during moments of need.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Helping (adjective) spirits</strong> describes a quality of being: presences that are steady, benevolent, grounding, and oriented toward restoration rather than domination.

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="spirits">Purpose & Orientation</h2>

      <p>
        This division does not claim authority over spiritual experience, nor does it prescribe belief. It offers language, structure, and symbolic tools for understanding support systems—whether understood psychologically, spiritually, culturally, or personally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Helping Spirits are not owned, commanded, or weaponized. They are recognized, respected, and engaged with responsibly.

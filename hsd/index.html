      <p>
        The Helping Spirits Division exists at the intersection of action and presence. It recognizes <em>helping</em> as both a <strong>verb</strong> and an <strong>adjective</strong>—the act of assisting, and the nature of benevolence itself.

    <!-- ANNOUNCEMENT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="spirits">Announcement · Technomantic High Craft</h2>

      <p>
        The Helping Spirits Division formally recognizes <strong>Technomantic High Craft</strong> as an active and valid framework within its scope of practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technomantic High Craft acknowledges that modern technology—when applied with conscious intent, ethical containment, and responsibility—may serve as a legitimate instrument in spiritual, metaphysical, and symbolic work.
      </p>

      <p>
        This framework does not separate technology from High Craft, nor does it diminish traditional practice. Instead, it affirms that tools evolve, while discipline, accountability, and coherence remain constant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the Helping Spirits Division, Technomantic High Craft is understood as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Technology used in service of intent, not distraction</li>
        <li>Modern tools applied with the same rigor as traditional methods</li>
        <li>Practice accountable to outcome, ethics, and impact</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This recognition exists to provide clarity—not prescription—and to support practitioners navigating contemporary realities without abandoning principled craft.

          <p>
            <strong>Helping (verb) spirits</strong> are those forces—internal or external, symbolic or experiential—that participate in guidance, protection, clarity, and support during moments of need.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Helping (adjective) spirits</strong> describes a quality of being: presences that are steady, benevolent, grounding, and oriented toward restoration rather than domination.

      <h2 class="spirits">Purpose & Orientation</h2>

      <p>
        This division does not claim authority over spiritual experience, nor does it prescribe belief. It offers language, structure, and symbolic tools for understanding support systems—whether understood psychologically, spiritually, culturally, or personally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Helping Spirits are not owned, commanded, or weaponized. They are recognized, respected, and engaged with responsibly.
